Welcome to Let's Go To War! Our app's main goal is to play out the normal card game of war, but with a small twist! 

To start a game a player must choose new game on the home screen. Once the button is pressed the player will be brought to the main page of our app where you can play war. 
Once on the main page there will be several elements on the screen. There will be two large cards located at the top and bottom of the screen with a smaller card and win counter next to it. 
The large cards represent which cards are being played with player 1 on the bottom and player 2 at the top. Each player has a smaller card in the corner with a counter to show how many cards they have left in their deck as well as a win counter to keep track of how many times they have taken their opponents cards. 

In the middle of the screen is a button that says "DEAL". This button when pressed deals out a new card for each player and are compared to decide the winner. 
As I mentioned before there is a twist to this game. When the two cards are compared the value of that card is compared(e.g. a 5 is worth 5 and a Jack is worth 11), but the suits are also compared. The hierarchy is as follows; Clubs over Diamonds, Diamonds over Hearts, Hearts over Spades, and Spades over Clubs. If there is a suit advantage the card with the advantage has a value of 1 added to its overall value.
If there is no suit advantage over another card they are compared at face value. 

In the event of a war, a small animation of two swords will appear as they fly together and then dissapear. After the animation finishes the player's cards will be dealt and compared along with the respective counters changing accordingly. 

If a player forgets the suit advantages or how to operate the app there is a help button found in the top right corner of the screen in the app bar next to the home button and themes button. When a player presses the help button a help alert appears and explains the rules of the game as well as some extra information.
If a player wishes to return to the home screen a player can press the home button and will be returned to the home screen where they can start a new game or continue the game they were in. 
If a plyer decides they want to spice up their game a bit or are getting tired of seeing the same old default colors they can press the themes button. This button will then allow the player to change the theme to their preference.

In the event a player wins they are given two options. Option one, labeled "New Game", allows them to instantly start a new game where they can then play another riveting game of war. Option two, labeled "Exit Game", will take the player back to the home screen.

Thank you for your interest in our game and I hope you enjoy!
